CPS School Ratings
==================

Decoding Chicago Public Schools school quality rating policy report as I prepare their 2014 report for integration into Chicago Cityscape. 

Issues
* The "Level 1+", "Level 1", "Level 2+", etc., school rating hierarchy doesn't get ordered properly with ordinary sorting functions in PostgreSQL and PHP. See [issue #1](../../issues/1).
